# TextbookQG- Adaptive Automatic Question Generation System
This project addresses the underutilization of textbooks in modern education, despite their comprehensive content that holds a wealth of knowledge essential for exceling in various subjects. Recognizing the challenges posed by traditional textbooks, which often lead to passive learning and low student engagement, this project presents TextbookQGâ€“ an innovative Automatic Question Generation (AQG) system designed to enhance textbook interactivity. The system has three primary objectives: to develop an Adaptive AQG system that generates multiple-choice questions targeting key concepts in digital textbooks, to integrate an adaptive learning model that provides a personalized learning experience, and to evaluate the system's effectiveness in generating high-quality questions and adapting to learners' needs. The system's workflow involves extracting and processing textbook PDF content, identifying important content, and using six question generators tailored to different difficulty levels to generate diverse questions. The system also includes an adaptive learning component that adjusts the difficulty of subsequent questions based on a user's previous responses, ensuring that users are consistently challenged at an appropriate level. Overall, the TextbookQG system contributes to educational technology by providing a scalable tool adaptable to different subjects and educational levels, promoting a more interactive and effective learning environment
